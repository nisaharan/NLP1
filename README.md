# NLP1
I learnt natural language processing (NLP) basics, such as how to identify and separate words, how to extract topics in a text, and how to build your own fake news classifier. I also learnt how to use basic libraries such as NLTK, alongside libraries which utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems.
